<p>Virtual Reality can be intimidating, especially when starting out. You are just getting into this new 'world' and there is so much to learn. What do you have to keep in mind Where to start How to start Well, we are here to give you some guidance - this is the ultimative VR guide for 2022.</p>
<p>Of course, starting out will be different depending on what you set out to do with VR: Do you want VR for private use or for your business For VR training or VR gaming What you need to start out will differ depending on your objective. There are some general things that stay the same, though.</p>
<p>All you need to start with Virtual Reality are generally:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
<li>VR headset and equipment</li>
<li>(depending on your headset) a PC or Smartphone</li>
<li>Space to move</li>
<li>Content to consume (games, apps, videos...)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. Not an extensive list, is it</p>
<p>The most important piece of your VR puzzle is arguably the VR headset, of course: it determines your VR experience from the get go. Let's talk about the differences in headsets.</p>
</div>
<div class="space-y-4">
<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-display font-bold">VR hardware: The different VR headsets</h2>
<p>What are Virtual Reality Headsets</p>
<p>A VR headset is a piece of hardway that usually has the look of a pair of goggles. Simply put: It allows you to experience the images of a game you play or video you watch to appear right before your eyes, as if you were in the middle of it.  But, which one to buy</p>
<p>The first thing you should consider is whether a tethered VR headset or a wireless one suits your needs the best. The main difference between those two is that a tethered headset is attached - tethered to a cable that connects to your computer or console, while a wireless one comes without one. They tend to be a bit more affordable than the tethered headsets,yet remain the less technically advanced option.</p>
</div>
<div class="space-y-4">
<h3 class="text-xl font-display font-semibold">Tethered VR headsets</h3>
<p>Tethered VR implies that the headset is actually physically attached to a computer with cables (such as HDMI and/or USB).Currently, they still provide a more advanced immersion than other VR headsets, they make for a higher quality experience as they have better graphics, sharper screens and more durable materials used in general.</p>
<p>What's the catch They need a fair amount of setup space, as well as a permanent wired connection to a high-powered gaming PC. There is the possibility of using wireless adapter technology to get both freedom of movement as well as a VR experience that is advanced and high quality.</p>
<p>However, tethered VR headsets come with a hefty price tag, not only for the goggles but also for the other equipment, like a powerful gaming computer and wireless adapters.</p>
</div>
<div class="space-y-4">
<h3 class="text-xl font-display font-semibold">Wireless/Mobile VR headsets</h3>
<p>The category of wireless headsets needs minimal external input. Other than charging the battery and perhaps creating an account to access certain VR platforms, standalone VR headsets require little else from the user. Cables are included with the devices to allow them to charge, but apart from that, wireless headsets don't need a connection to work.</p>
<p>Other benefits include a much simpler set up than is necessary for tethered devices, as well as increased comfort and mobility. They are also less expensive than most tethered options.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some other features worth checking out before settling on a headset:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Comfort</li>
<li>Field of view</li>
<li>Tracking area</li>
<li>Built in audio or mic</li>
<li>Controller</li>
<li>Sensors</li>
<li>Connections</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="space-y-4">
<h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-display font-bold">What else to consider</h2>
<p>Okay, now that you have chosen your VR headset, the other things are quickly figured out. You just need a space that allows you to move freely and content that you can consume on your headset. Then you're set to go!</p>
<p>Talking about content, there are some things that can make your life easier, like a VR CMS, a Virtual Reality Content Management System.</p>
<p>A VR CMS makes sense for you if you want to use your VR headset not for gaming, but your business for VR training and learning, because it helps you to keep the overview over your different courses and pieces of content. Learn more about CMS right here or check out what you need to know before implementing VR in your business.</p>
<p>To sum up our VR guide: Starting with VR is not as difficult as it sounds. You should consider your needs and choose a headset that fits them. Then you are good to go and explore what VR has to offer - privately or for your business.</p>
